it should be in a new branch

git branch
List all branches. 

git branch <branch>
--> Create a new branch called ＜branch＞. This does not check out the new branch.

git branch -d <branch>
--> Delete the specified branch. 
--> This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents you from 
--> deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.

git branch -D <branch>
--> Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes.

git branch -m <branch>
--> Rename the current branch to ＜branch＞.

git branch -a
List all remote branches.
